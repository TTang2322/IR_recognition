Description of some files and folds

	1. IR_recognition_model_training.py is used to train deep learning model
	2. The structure of model is shown in figure structure_IR_recognition_model.png
	3. The trained datasets are stored in fold datasets named X.npy and Y.npy
	4. The trained model is stored in fold models, named model_IR_recognition.h5
	5. The performance of trainging processes are shown in images which are stored in fold performance_images
	6. load_model2recognize.py is used to load the trained model for recognizing
	7. The testing datasets are stored in fold datasets named X_test.npy and Y_test.npy
	8. descriptionOfmodel.txt is the description of trained model
	9. result_training.png and result_testing.png are the screenshot of training and testing result

How to run program

	The program is coded in python, so when you want to run certain program, you can type as following:

	python scriptName.py

	in terminal. For example, if you want to run IR_recognition_model_training.py, you should type:

	python IR_recognition_model_training.py
	and press Enter
